      <p>This project was a project where I had built a game that had you defeat balloons before it reached the cannons. I accomplished it through the use of the CMU Academy coding. It helped me learn the sophistication of coding and how complex it could get. Although it did take awhile to create, it was a fun experience to achieve with coding.</p>

      <p>This project was a project for the Congressional App Challenge. Me and my partner would spend a bunch of time on this, planning each of the sprites and what the app would do. This app would teach people the basics of driving, allowing them to go through lessons and do a test drive.</p>

      <h2>Snowflake Project</h2>
      <p>This was a project where we had to create a pattern using the code. We accomplished it by using the pinwheel branches to create this effect. We did struggle with creating the color pattern in the image, but it was solved through the way the “change crayon ____” block worked.</p>
